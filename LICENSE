                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying this Library.

  You may convey a copy of the Library under this License, provided that
you comply with the requirements of the GNU GPL for conveying any
covered work.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Library.

  You may convey a Combined Work, provided that you give prominent notice
with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that
the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a
copy of this License.  If the Combined Work is an executable work, you
must also make available under this License the source code for the
Library, unless the recipient already has such source code.

  If you place such prominent notice in a Combined Work, you may specify
that certain files of the Library are under different licenses.

  4. Combined Libraries.

  You may place Library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other Library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, provided that you otherwise comply with the terms of this
License with respect to the Library facilities.

  5. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work for use in, or to run on, a specific
machine provided that you give clear instructions for how the Library
can be separately obtained and/or installed on that machine.

  You may convey such a Combined Work provided that you comply with
the terms of the GNU GPL for conveying any covered work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.
